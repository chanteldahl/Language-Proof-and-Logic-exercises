EXERCISE 3.3

  Sentences 3.3  (Student file: "Sentences 3.3.sen")

     *** Your sentence file contained only 9 sentences.  We expected 10 
         sentences.
     *** Your fourth sentence, "c # b", is not the same as the sentence in the 
         book.
     *** Your fifth sentence, "~(d # e)", is not the same as the sentence in 
         the book.
     *** Your sixth sentence, "~SameShape(f, c)", is not the same as the 
         sentence in the book.
     *** Your seventh sentence, "~~SameShape(d, c)", is not the same as the 
         sentence in the book.
     *** Your eighth sentence, "~Cube(e)", is not the same as the sentence in 
         the book.
     *** Your ninth sentence, "~Tet(c)", is not the same as the sentence in the

  World 3.3  (Student file: "World 3.3.wld")
     Your world is correct.  Too cool!

EXERCISE 3.7

  World 3.7  (Student file: "World 3.7.wld")
     Your world is correct.  Amazing!

EXERCISE 3.10

  Sentences 3.10  (Student file: "Sentences 3.10.sen")
     Your sentences are all correct.  Jings!

  World 3.10  (Student file: "World 3.10.wld")
     Your world is correct.  Party on!

EXERCISE 3.15

  World 3.15  (Student file: "World 3.15.wld")
     Your world is a counterexample to the given argument.  Woohoo!

EXERCISE 3.16

  World 3.16.1  (Student file: "World 3.16.1.wld")
     Your world is correct.  Zany!

  World 3.16.2  (Student file: "World 3.16.2.wld")
     Your world is correct.  Bully!

EXERCISE 3.18

  Sentences 3.18  (Student file: "Sentences 3.18.sen")
     We found problems in your sentences:
     *** Your sixth sentence, "SameSize(a, d) & SameShape(a, d)", is not 
         equivalent to any of the expected answers.  This one is a bit tricky.  
         You need to find a sentence that doesn't use identity, but which can't 
         be true of two different blocks in Tarski's World.

EXERCISE 3.21

  Sentences 3.21  (Student file: "Sentences 3.21.sen")
     We found problems in your sentences:
     *** Your first sentence, "Small(a) v (Large(b) & Large(c))", is not 
         equivalent to any of the expected translations.
     *** Your fifth sentence, "~(RightOf(e, c) & LeftOf(e, b)) v 
         ~(RightOf(a, c) & LeftOf(a, b))", is not equivalent to any of the


 
 
         expected translations.  This English sentence can be confusing.  Try 
         translating "e is to the right of c and to the left of b" and "a is to 
         the right of c and to the left of b".  Then say that neither of these 
         is the case.
