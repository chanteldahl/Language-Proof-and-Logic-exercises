     We found problems in your sentences:
     -NOTE: In these translations, it's essential that you use the right 
      predicates, function symbols, and constants.  (Remember "Square" and "2" 
      are not part of the language.  "<" is part of the language, but ">" is 
      not.)  To enter the multiplication symbol, you must type the asterisk 
      (*), not "x", which is a variable.
     *** Your first sentence, "Az (~Prime(zxz))", doesn't match the expected 
         translation.
     *** Your second sentence, "Ez (~Even(zxz))", doesn't match the expected 
         translation.
     *** Your third sentence, "Az (Prime(z) -> Prime(zxz))", doesn't match the 
         expected translation.
     *** Your fourth sentence, "Az ((Prime(z) & z#2) -> ~Even(zxz))", doesn't 
         match the expected translation.
     *** Your fifth sentence, "Az ((Smaller(1, zxz)) -> Smaller(z, zxz))",
