Assume that b is a tetrahedron, c is a cube and either c is larger than b or else they are identical.
Since b is a tetrahedron and c is a cube, they can not be identical, 
so the only way "either c is larger than b or else they are identical" can be true is if c is larger than b, 
that is, b is smaller than c.
