Suppose that
(i) for all x, y, if x is to the left of y, then x is larger than y.
(ii) for all x, if x is a cube, then it is small.
(iii) for all x, if x is a tet, then it is large.
(iv) for all x, y, if x is small and y is small, then x is not larger than y.

Suppose that exists d and e that d is a cube, e is a cube and d is to the right of e.
If d is a cube, then it is small (ii).
If e is a cube, then it is small (ii).
If d is to the right of e, then e is to the left of d.
If e is to the left of d, then e is larger then d (i).
But e can not be larger then d, since both are small.
So does not exist d and e that d is a cube, e is a cube and d is to the right of e.
