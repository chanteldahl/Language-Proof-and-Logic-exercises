Suppose that 
(i) b has the same shape as c.

(a) Suppose b is a cube. From Axiom 8 and (i), c is a cube. If c is a cube and b is a cube, from Axiom 5, c has the same shape as b.

(b) Suppose b is a dodec. From Axiom 9 and (i), c is a dodec. If c is a dodec and b is a dodec, from Axiom 6, c has the same shape as b.

(c) Suppose b is a tet. From Axiom 10 and (i), c is a tet. If c is a tet and b is a tet, from Axiom 7, c has the same shape as b.

From Axiom 4, (a), (b) and (c), it's possible to conclude that c has the same shape as b.
