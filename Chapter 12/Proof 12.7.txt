Suppose that
(i) for all x, x is a cube or x is a dodec,
(ii) for all x, if x is a cube, then it's large and to then left of c and 
(iii) for all x, if is not small, then it's a tet.

Suppose d is a cube, then it's large and to the left of c (ii).
Since d is large, then it's a tet (iii). That is not possible, since d is a cube.

Suppose d is a dodec. If it's a dodec then exists a dodec.

So it's possible to conclude that d is a dodec.
