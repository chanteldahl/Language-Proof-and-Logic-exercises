Suppose that 
(i) for all y, y is a cube or a dodec, 
(ii) for all y, if y is a cube, then it's large and 
(iii) exists y that is not large. 

Since exists y that is not large and all cubes are large, y can not be a cube. 
Because for all y, y is a cube or a dodec, it can only be a dodec.

So it's possible to conclude that exists a dodec.
