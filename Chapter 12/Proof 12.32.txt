Suppose that
(i) for all x, x is a cube or for all x, x is a tet or for all x, x is a dodec.

If for all x, x is a cube, then, by the Axiom 5, it's possible to conclude that for all x, y, x has the same shape as y.

If for all x, x is a tet or if for all x, x is a dodec, the same process can be applied using the Axiom 6 and 7.

So it's possible to conclude that for all x, y, x has the same shape as y.
