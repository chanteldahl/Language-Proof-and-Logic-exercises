# Language, Proof and Logic exercises

My exercises from the **Language, Proof and Logic** book.

**Some answers may be wrong or missing**, you can see which ones on **Feedback files**. I solved some wrong and missing questions and wrote PROBLEM(S) SOLVED after the description of the problem(s) in these questions, but I still cannot guarantee they are correct with the changes. Be careful with these questions.
